## Aram Simonian

I'm a Chemical Engineering graduate with twenty years' IT experience (both dev and support) in the financial services industry. Simplifying people's working lives, usually using technology, is what I love most about IT.

By engaging with end users and understanding their needs and wants, I've regularly reduced process execution times by 50% - 80% (sometimes even more).  As importantly, what's left behind is a better-structured, documented solution that's easier on the end user and anyone who has to maintain it.

I'm looking for more of the same: the opportunity to have people actually enjoy their work because the tools they use are so awesome.  I've worked in many different areas in finance and I'd be very happy to explore opportunities elsewhere as well.


## Skills

#### VBA

VB/VBA/VBScript is my main skill right now and I've used it to solve business problems and automate business processes and reporting for a long time.  I've not found my experience matched very often and I have been told that the performance I seek is impossible using VBA.  Re-writing a data load process to include data validation rules and then also achieving a 97% reduction in execution time was particularly satisfying (~1hr down to under 2 mins). 

There's always more to learn, but I'm starting to feel the boundaries and limits of VBA.

#### SQL

SQL has always been a secondary skill that's often complemented my VBA.  I have a good grasp of it and know sufficient database theory to trouble-shoot queries.  I'm most comfortable with SQL Server, but I have worked with Sybase and Oracle.

#### PowerShell

I have some limited experience with PowerShell, gained through one of my contracts at HSBC.  I used it to help to automate the analysis of a large database my team was looking to demise.
