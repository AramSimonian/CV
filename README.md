## Aram Simonian

I'm a Chemical Engineering graduate with twenty years' IT experience (both dev and support) in the financial services industry. Simplifying people's working lives, often using technology, is why I went into IT.

By engaging with end users and understanding their needs and wants, I've regularly reduced process execution times by 50% - 80% (sometimes even higher).  As importantly, what's left behind is a better-structured, documented solution that's easier on the end user and anyone who has to maintain it.

I'm looking for more of the same: the opportunity to let people actually enjoy their work because the tools they use are so awesome.  I've worked in many different areas in finance, but I'd be very happy to explore opportunities elsewhere as well.

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

## Skills

#### VBA

VB/VBA/VBScript is my main skill and I've used it to solve business problems and automate business processes and reporting for a long time.  Amongst my peers, I've not met many who are at my level and on a few occasions I've been told that my achievements are impossible using VBA.  Re-writing a data load process to include data validation rules and then also achieving a 97% reduction was particularly satisfying (1hr down to under 2 mins). 

There's always more to learn, but I'm starting to feel hemmed in by the language itself, which doesn't encourage collaboration.

#### SQL

SQL has always been a secondary skill that's often complemented my VBA.  I have a good grasp of it and know sufficient database theory to trouble-shoot queries.  I'm most comfortable with SQL Server, but I have worked with Sybase and Oracle.
